<h2>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h2>
<p>We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage.

To protect the anonymity of this information, we use encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can’t identify you personally.</p>
<p>These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you’ve downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non-precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Application and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use.</p>
<p>If you’d like to opt-out from third party use of this type of information to help serve targeted advertising, please visit the section entitled “Opt-out” below.</p>
